# tictactoe
A simple Tic Tac Toe game written in Python. Partly inspired by codeacademy's battleship tutorial.

Features:
- play against an AI
- choose who starts
- replay as long as you want
- statistics for a whole session

Maybe future features:
- make AI not totally random
- add 2 player option
- import/export statistics
